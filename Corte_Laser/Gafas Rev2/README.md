<h2>Updated Version of Laser cut Protective Googles</h2>

This revision adresses concerns and issues that were stated during testing and feedback.

Main things changed are:

- Easily detachable (for sanitizing) foam inserts in the parts that touch the face of the user.
- Changed the design of the back part that holds the rubber bands (we are using Number 14 or 140mm. diameter rubbers) to provide redundancy in case of faliure and also adding 1 size more, in case is needed.
- Lots little things regarding tolerances, so its easier to assemble.

Important things:

We are not using rectangles anymore when cutting the glass. Those were so tiny that heat resoldered them and its removal was time consuming. No what we do is 3 different passes of straight lines with the lasercutter, defocusing them. Overall it takes much less time doing so.

Our Laser cutter is a Trotec Speedy 400 Co2 120W, so we can provide values for this machine, but if you have othe machine, it'll be a little bit of trial and error when you first test it. In order to do so, we provide a little file for callibretion purposes.
We also provide the file for the jig that we use to assemble the goggles. I cannot remark enough how valuable it is to speed up assembly times.

Hope you find the design useful and feel free to copy, reproduce or remix all or any part or solutions in it.

Thank you!
